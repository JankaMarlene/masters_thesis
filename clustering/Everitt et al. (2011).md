# Cluster Analysis. Everitt et al., 2011

## Introduction
- Classification
  - For organizing large data set, so it can be understood more easily & information retrieved more efficiently
  - If data validly summarized by small number of groups of objects, then the group labels may provide very concise description of patterns of similarities and differences in data
  - To understand & treat disease it has to be classified
    - Two main aims
      - **prediction**
      - **aetiology**
        - Causes of different types of disease
- *Object* -> people we look at
- Overlapping clusters
- Cluster analysis essentially about discovering groups in data
- Cluster define it in terms of internal cohesion **homogeneity** & external isolation **separation**
- Cluster analysis techniques are concerned with exploring data sets to assess whether or not they can be summarized meaningfully in terms of a relatively small number of groups or clusters of objects or  individuals which resemble each other and which are different in some respects from individuals in other clusters

## Model-based cluster analysis for structured data
- HADS -> Multivariate datas (anxiety and depression) meassured on the same scale
- Described here: More formal statistical alternative to the two-stage approach
- Structured data

## Some final comments and guidelines
- Cluster analysis does not involve simply the application of particular techenique bur rather necessitates a series of steps, each of which may be dependent on results of the preceding one
- It is generally impossible **a priori** to anticipate what combination of variables, similarity measures and clustering techniques is likely to lead to interesting and informative classifications
- Analysis proceeds through several stages
- Final, extremely important stage concerns the evaluation of the clustering solutions obtained
  - Are the clusters real or merely artefacts of the algorithms?
  - Do other solutions exist which are better?
  - Can the clusters be given a convincing interpretation?
  - A long list of such questions (which are full of traps for the unwary; see *Dubes and Jain, 1979*) might be posed
