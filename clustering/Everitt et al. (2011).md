# Cluster Analysis. Everitt et al., 2011

## Introduction
- Classification
  - For organizing large data set, so it can be understood more easily & information retrieved more efficiently
  - If data validly summarized by small number of groups of objects, then the group labels may provide very concise description of patterns of similarities and differences in data
  - To understand & treat disease it has to be classified
    - Two main aims
      - **prediction**
      - **aetiology**
        - Causes of different types of disease
- *Object* -> people we look at
- Overlapping clusters
- Cluster analysis essentially about discovering groups in data
- Cluster define it in terms of internal cohesion **homogeneity** & external isolation **separation**
- Cluster analysis techniques are concerned with exploring data sets to assess whether or not they can be summarized meaningfully in terms of a relatively small number of groups or clusters of objects or  individuals which resemble each other and which are different in some respects from individuals in other clusters
